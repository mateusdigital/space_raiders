Space Raiders is a small console shoot'em'up created as a toy project using
the very interesting [Console Game Engine by Javidx9](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/Javidx9/tree/master/ConsoleGameEngine).

It was created around 2015-2016 (I don't quite remember exactly) as a test task
for a company that I was applying back then.

For a long time I forgot this project, but decided to release it now :)

As usual, you are **very welcomed** to **share** and **hack** it.
